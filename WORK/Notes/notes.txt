    VWAP
    In financial markets, the Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) is a technical analysis tool that 
    calculates the average price of a security over a period, giving more weight to prices with higher 
    trading volume. It's a popular indicator for intraday trading, helping traders identify potential 
    trend reversals and support/resistance levels.
